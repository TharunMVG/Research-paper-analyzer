This folder contains the ipynb notebooks required to deploy the project. The main notebook that needs to be executed is Paper_analyser.ipynb. The other notebooks contain logic for preprocessing (enhanced_nlp.py), prompt engineering (prompt_enginnering.py), fine-tuning(model_finetuning.py), vector databases, and knowledge graph techniques to extract research gaps, challenges, future work, and limitations from papers (Paper_analyser.ipynb).
